# QUBE_Directors_Cut_savegame

Modded savegame for Q.U.B.E: Director's Cut.
It should be used for "achievement hunter" who have done all the achievements in this game legit,
except for the following 3 (which take too much time and are annoying if you already did all other achievements):

Q.U.B.E. Master
      -Play the game 500 times
You've Got A Problem
      -Collect 10,000 pickups
Then I Can Walk 90,000 More!
      -Travel 100,000 metres

The savegame therefore has the following entries:

Total Pickups:		9999
Total Times Played:	499
Total Distance:		99 879m

Just play and finish the last level of the DLC ("Space Race") and collect at least one pickup 
in order to get all 3 achievements.

Have fun ;)
